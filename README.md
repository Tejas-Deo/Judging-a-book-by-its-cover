# Judging-a-book-by-its-cover
>OpenCV, Machine Learning

This project is an improvised version of a CBIR (Content Based Image Retrieval) system. Once the user clicks a picture of a book-cover in real-time, we use a 3-Level matching system to retrieve closest matches of the book-cover and based on the retrieved book-cover it displays the summarised information about various aspects of the book that is obtained from sites such as Goodreads and Amazon.

3-Level matchingÂ system:
* Level-1: RGB Colour Histogram.
* Level-2: Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).
* Level-3: FLANN matching using SIFT features.
Basing idea of this 3-Level matching system is to narrow down on the exact match by eliminating irrelevant matches at every level. As the level increases accuracy of the results produced by the matcher increases and also the time taken by it for matching increases.
If we eliminate more matches at initial levels, then the time taken by matcher at next level will decrease but at the same time potential matches might have been eliminated at the previous level, thus reducing the accuracy of the entire system.
If we eliminate very few matches at initial levels, thus passing higher number of matches to next level matcher, the time take of the system increases drastically, but accuracy of the system is not compromised.
Hence we decrease the number of potential matches at each level,but not by eliminating too many matches, thus we are fine-tuning between speed and accuracy.

10-Step Process:
* Step-1: Build a repository of all the available book covers along with their respective ISBN number.
* Step-2: Compute RGB Colour Histograms for all the book-cover images in repository.
* Step-3: Read-in the query book-cover and compute its colour histogram.
* Step-4: Search for closest matches of the query book-cover in the image repository based on correlation between histograms. (Level-1 Matcher).
* Step-5: Search for closest matches of query book-cover from the matches obtained in Step-4 using SSIM. (Level-2 Matcher).
* Step-6: Search for closest matches of query book-cover from the matches obtained in Step-5 using FLANN. (Level-3 Matcher).
* Step-7: Display the top-4 matches obtained after 3 levels of matching. Also display the number of SIFT features matched in those top-4 retrieved images.
* Step-8: Draw the matches between query book-cover image and top match.
* Step-9: Create a web crawler to scrape information from Goodreads and Amazon.
* Step-10: Using ISBN of the top match and the crawler designed in Step-9, retrieve additional book information such as number of ratings, average rating, helpful comments, number of pages in book, author details, etc. And finally display a summarised version of the information obtained.
